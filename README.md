Module Eight

## Who was the client?
•	DriverPass will provide online practice tests and training to help prepare people for their driving tests.
•	They want a website for the training and online practice tests. They also want to have an app that gives feedback to drivers while they're on the road. They want this system to show customers their data both online and offline, from anywhere. Additionally, they want to offer in-person classes for driving, available via appointments.

## What did you do particularly well?
• I compared the process and object models by describing each one's purpose and each one's advantages.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
• I would revise the Gantt chart. The dates given by the assignment made it impossible to map to the current or any recent years.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
• In my design, I didn't add or remove functionality based on my opinion. I accounted for exactly what the customer wants the program to do.
• It's important to consider the user's needs when designing so that your design is clear to them. Also there's no point in designing something that the customer doesn't ask for.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
• I think of what the users want. I gather user data, create surveys, conduct interviews, and prototype.
